## Hi there! I am Ray.

I am currently a Ph.D. student in Mechanical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. I am working at the [Visual Design and Engineering Lab](http://vdel.me.cmu.edu/). I am advised by Professor [Levent Burak Kara](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/kara-burak.html). 

My research interest includes additive manufacturing, computational design, and computer graphics. My current work involves using neural network based topology optimization. My long term Ph.D. project is generative manufacturing. 

In my spare time, I do design for additive manufacturing. I design my own 3D printer and it helped me to realize many other cool designs.
